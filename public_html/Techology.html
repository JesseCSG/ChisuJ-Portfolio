            NetBeans and CSS
        </h3>
        
        <p>
                The technology we currently working with is called CSS and NetBeans.<br />
            NetBeans is the mother of all programming. We've learned and will <br />
            remember many of the items, such as how to put an image on the website,<br />
            put background colors to the website, and even create links to other<br />
            pages.<br />
            <br />
                Css is basically the tech world of NetBeans. In Css, we basically adjust,<br />
             add on, and extent everything in the website itself. Think of it as the <br />
            photoshop of websites, adding background images and changing the font or<br />
            the size of the letters.
