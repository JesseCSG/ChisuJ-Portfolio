            </h3>
        
            <p>
                    The technology we currently working with is called CSS and NetBeans.<br />
                NetBeans is the mother of all programming. We've learned and will <br />
                remember many of the items, such as how to put an image on the website,<br />
                put background colors to the website, and even create links to other<br />
                pages.<br />
                <br />
                    Html is more or les the motherboard to the starship. It's the main hub<br />
                of where you put your main items, write down and draft paragraphs. In <br />
                the normal HTMl, you are able to add vidoes, sound, images, and even links<br />
                to external websites such as <a src="youtube.com">Youtube.com</a>.<br />
                    <br />
                    Css is basically the tech world of NetBeans. In Css, we basically adjust,<br />
                 add on, and extent everything in the website itself. Think of it as the <br />
                photoshop of websites, adding background images and changing the font or<br />
                the size of the letters.<br />
                <br />
                    <br />
                        <br />
                            <br />
                                <br />
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
