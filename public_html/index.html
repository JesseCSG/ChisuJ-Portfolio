                    Hello, and I am a student here in Pasadena High School. I am currently<br />
                enrolled in the <a href="http://www.theappacademy.us/">The App Academy</a>, creating websites such as the one<br />
                the see before you. I am 14 years old and I am currently a Freshmen at<br />
                my school. 
            </p>
            <a href='Techology.html'>
                <img src="Misc/Picture.png">
            </a>
            <p>
                Be amazed to know and to find out that not only is<br />
                the picture you see above you as a robit, but it's <br />
                also a link to an incredible branch of my website..<br />
                The Technology Page. Click the robit now to see!<br />
                <br />
                This is one of my favorite videos for two reasons: <br />
                1: The man behind is a animator on youtube, who's actually really good.<br />
                2: It's not that bad. If your older, you might not like it, so please don't hate.
                <br />
