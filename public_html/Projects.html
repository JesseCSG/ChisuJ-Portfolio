            <p>
                My current projects is a how-to to website making.<br />
                In my class, the objective of the portfolio is to <br />
                impress employers in a job interview and what not. <br />
                <br />
                I feel the best thing about this project is that <br />
                were training and getting used to coding programs<br />
                such as the one you see before you, named NetBeans.
                <br />
                In the future, we'll attempt into creating basis <br />
                video games like Snake or Mario original.
